# PriceOptimizer 

>Most RPG multiplayer based video games have standalone static prices for goods and a single value of a currency, while this approach works, when you introduce trading with players, things begin to go downhill, and the values of goods diminish.
___

This script **automates** the process of setting correct prices for your in-game goods through only supply and demand variables, everything else can be tweaked to your liking. 

This repo will be updated frequently.

### Setup

1. Drag and drop the script to your desired location in Unity
2. Connect the variables to your shopkeeper(s) script, functionality will be added in the future
3. Set the **original price** to your desired goods price
4. The weight is how vigorous the price change is, the higher the value the smaller the price change (recommended 1000)
5. Change Supply and Demand values accordingly to see the price change
